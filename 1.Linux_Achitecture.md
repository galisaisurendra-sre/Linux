## 1.Linux System Architecture Overview

Linux is designed in a layered architecture, where each layer has a specific role.

#### 1.1 Hardware (Bottom Layer)

This is the physical layer — CPU, memory, disk, network card, etc.
It’s what Linux runs on and manages.

Examples: CPU cores, RAM, SSD/HDD, network interfaces (eth0, wlan0)

### 1.2. Kernel

The core of Linux — acts as a bridge between hardware and software.
It handles:

Process management (running programs)

Memory management

Device drivers

Networking

System calls

🧠 Think of it as the brain of the OS.

### 1.3.System Libraries

These are helper programs that let user applications talk to the kernel easily without dealing with low-level hardware.
Example: glibc — the GNU C Library, used by almost every program.

Functions like reading files, printing text, or allocating memory use these libraries.

### 1.4. User Applications

Everything you interact with: commands, shells, GUIs, and services.

Shells: bash, zsh, fish

Editors: vim, nano

Servers: nginx, sshd

Desktop environments: GNOME, KDE

## Flow of Interaction

```
User → Shell → System Libraries → Kernel → Hardware

1️⃣ User → Shell:
You type a command (like ls /home).

2️⃣ Shell → System Libraries:
The shell calls a function (e.g., opendir(), readdir()) from the system libraries (like glibc).

3️⃣ System Libraries → Kernel:
Those libraries make system calls to the kernel (like getdents()), requesting data from the filesystem.

4️⃣ Kernel → Hardware:
The kernel fetches the data from disk hardware using device drivers.

5️⃣ Hardware → Kernel:
The disk sends data (directory contents) back to the kernel.

6️⃣ Kernel → System Libraries:
The kernel returns the results (data buffers) to the system libraries through the same system call channel.

7️⃣ System Libraries → Shell:
The libraries process and format the raw data (convert bytes to readable filenames) and send it to the shell.

8️⃣ Shell → User (Screen):
Finally, the shell displays the output text to your terminal.

```

## Why We Need a Shell in Linux

A shell is needed because it acts as the **bridge between you (the user) and the Linux kernel (the core of the operating system).**

The kernel can’t directly understand human input — it understands system calls, not words.
The shell translates your commands into something the kernel can execute.
