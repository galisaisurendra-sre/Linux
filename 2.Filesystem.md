| Directory | Description                                                         |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/`       | Root directory — the base of the entire filesystem.                 |
| `/bin`    | Essential user commands like `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `cat`, etc.          |
| `/boot`   | Bootloader files and Linux kernel needed to start the system.       |
| `/dev`    | Device files representing hardware (e.g., `/dev/sda`, `/dev/null`). |
| `/etc`    | System configuration files for all programs and services.           |
| `/home`   | User home directories (e.g., `/home/alex`, `/home/surendra`).       |
| `/lib`    | Essential shared libraries used by programs in `/bin` and `/sbin`.  |
| `/media`  | Mount points for removable media like USB drives or CDs.            |
| `/mnt`    | Temporary mount point for manually mounted filesystems.             |
| `/opt`    | Optional or third-party software packages.                          |
| `/proc`   | Virtual filesystem with runtime system and process information.     |
| `/root`   | Home directory of the root (administrator) user.                    |
| `/run`    | Runtime information for processes and services after boot.          |
| `/sbin`   | System administration binaries (e.g., `reboot`, `fdisk`).           |
| `/srv`    | Data for services provided by the system (e.g., web/FTP content).   |
| `/sys`    | Virtual filesystem exposing kernel and hardware info.               |
| `/tmp`    | Temporary files — usually cleared on reboot.                        |
| `/usr`    | Secondary hierarchy for user programs and data (e.g., `/usr/bin`).  |
| `/var`    | Variable data like logs, cache, mail, and spool directories.        |
